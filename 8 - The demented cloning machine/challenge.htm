<h2>Challenge 8: <strong>The demented cloning machine</strong></h2>
<p>A crazy scientist has invented a wonderful cloning machine. He is offering it to a group of N people in order to test its performance. The machine has just started to do the magic. However, something strange is happening. Instead of creating perfect clones, the artifact is having some trouble.</p>

<p> Each time a person tries to be cloned, an unpredictable V number of clones appear, occasionally with very different appearances. As expected, the person doesn’t like the result and they return to the machine to try it again.</p>

<p> The scientist has noticed this issue and he is trying to adjust its behavior. To do so, he is cloning all the people in the queue, and after the queue is empty he regulates the machine, changes the settings, and starts over in the same order as the previous test.</p>

<p> After C series of clones, the scientist desists and runs away from his laboratory, leaving a furious crowd of people. </p>

<p> <strong>Note:</strong> if a transformation is not specified, it is supposed that the person is not cloned and he returns to the queue with no alteration. </p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p> The input is composed of two parts. First, the original queue of people waiting to be cloned, each one represented as a single character. The second part is the list of T transformations that are done in each one of the C series, represented as PERSON_LIKE_x=&gt;CLONES,PERSON_LIKE_y=&gt;CLONES.</p>

<h3> Ouput </h3>
<p> MD5 sum of the queue of people after the C series.</p>

<h3> Limits </h3>
N ≤ 10<sup>5</sup> <br>
C ≤ 15 <br>
T ≤ 52 <br>
V ≤ 10 <br>

<h3> Sample input </h3>

<code>abadrec<br>
a=&gt;ca,d=&gt;pip,u=&gt;as<br>
p=&gt;vt,e=&gt;yt</code>

<h3>Sample output</h3>

<code>81f63bcb2f85d1f1118df246f588c4d1</code>

<h2>Submit &amp; test your code</h2>
<p>To test and submit code we provide a set of tools to help you. Download
<a href="https://contest.tuenti.net/Info/tools">contest tools</a> if you haven't already done that. You will then be able to test and submit your solution to this
challenge with the challenge token.</p>
<code>Challenge token: 7fHKSe2BTBndVdufTLwS</code>
<br>
<h3>To test your program</h3>
<code>./test_challenge 7fHKSe2BTBndVdufTLwS path/program</code>
<p>A nice output will tell you if your program got the right solution or not. You can try as
many times as you need.</p>
<h3>To submit your program to the challenge</h3>
<code>./submit_challenge 7fHKSe2BTBndVdufTLwS path/source_pkg.tgz path/program</code>
<p>Note that you first need to solve the test phase before submitting the code. During the submit phase we
might give your program harder questions, so try to make your program failsafe.</p>
<p>Remember <b>you can only submit once!</b> Once your solution is submitted you won't be able to amend it to fix issues or make it faster,
so please be sure your program is finished before submitting it.</p>
<p>If you have any doubts, please check the <a href="https://contest.tuenti.net/Info/help">help section</a>.</p>


<h2>Go ahead</h2>
<h3>I'm done! :)</h3>
<p>Once you have submitted your code, hit refresh and continue to next challenge.</p>
<h3>I'm stuck! :(</h3>
<p>Be sure you follow the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/TuentiEng">Tuenti Engineering</a> twitter for updates and
possible hints during the contest.</p>
<p>If this challenge is too hard and you are blocked, you will be able to skip it after two hours. Note that
<strong>you won't be able to complete it later</strong>, and you have a limited number of challenges to skip.</p>
