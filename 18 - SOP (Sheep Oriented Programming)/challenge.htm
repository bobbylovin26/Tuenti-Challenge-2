<p>Finally, the software community has realised the innate skills that <strong>sheep</strong> have for programming. After trying with cows, orangutan and fish, software companies have found that the best alternative to expensive and bug-producing teams of human software engineers comes in the form of a flock of woolly programmers. Sheep, widely accepted as the most intelligent species on Earth, are happy with fresh grass and of course, a programming language adapted to their rich <abbr title="Basically made of one word, “Bee”. This spelling corresponds to the Spanish pronunciation, but English speaking sheep can easily adapt it replacing it by “Baa”. Sheep have always been surprised by all the trouble humans suffer when translating between two of their overly complex human languages.">vocabulary</abbr> full of nuances that allows them to show their awesome potential. <strong>Admire it:</strong></p>

You can download the code above <a href="https://contest.tuenti.net/resources/files/program.bee">here</a>.

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, C, and C test cases follow (1 ≤ C ≤ 1000). Each test case consists of a line with an integer N, 0 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>9.</sup></p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: P", where x is the case number (starting from 1) and P is the solution.</p>

<h2>Submit &amp; test your code</h2>
<p>To test and submit code we provide a set of tools to help you. Download
<a href="https://contest.tuenti.net/Info/tools">contest tools</a> if you haven't already done that. You will then be able to test and submit your solution to this
challenge with the challenge token.</p>
<code>Challenge token: IvDEIWUC5WWKaXKfTLwS</code>
<br>
<h3>To test your program</h3>
<code>./test_challenge IvDEIWUC5WWKaXKfTLwS path/program</code>
<p>A nice output will tell you if your program got the right solution or not. You can try as
many times as you need.</p>
<h3>To submit your program to the challenge</h3>
<code>./submit_challenge IvDEIWUC5WWKaXKfTLwS path/source_pkg.tgz path/program</code>
<p>Note that you first need to solve the test phase before submitting the code. During the submit phase we
might give your program harder questions, so try to make your program failsafe.</p>
<p>Remember <b>you can only submit once!</b> Once your solution is submitted you won't be able to amend it to fix issues or make it faster,
so please be sure your program is finished before submitting it.</p>
<p>If you have any doubts, please check the <a href="https://contest.tuenti.net/Info/help">help section</a>.</p>
