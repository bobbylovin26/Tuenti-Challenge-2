<h2>Challenge 9: <strong>Il nomme della magnolia</strong></h2>
<div class="center">

</div>
<p>You have just entered a secret room, and in this secret room there is a secret computer, and inside the computer there is a secret file full of knowledge dating back to the dawn of time. Everything looks wonderful, magnificent... outrageous! But you just realised that the building is on fire and you have no time to read millions of pages. You need to search really fast inside the documents in order to find the most interesting parts and run for your life! You decided to write a program to do it (it is an advantage to be the fastest programmer in the world). Good luck!</p>

<p>The documents are inside <a href="https://contest.tuenti.net/resources/files/documents.7z">this archive (7zip)</a>. Apart from whitespaces, you can find only text written with letters (a to z) and numbers; no commas, dots or other punctuation symbols. There are exactly 800 documents, from 0001 to 0800.</p>

<p>Given a word and an integer representing the appearance of that word in the bunch of documents, you need to find the <strong>document, line and position within that line</strong> for the word (<strong>case-insensitive</strong>). For example, if the input is <strong>king 27</strong> and the word king appears 20 times in document 0001, 2 times in document 0002 and 8 times in document 0003, you are looking for the 5th occurrence of the word king in document 0003. Suppose that the 5th appearance of the word king is on line 302 and it is the first word on that line. You need to return <strong>3-302-1</strong></p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, C, and C test cases follow (1 ≤ C ≤ 120). Each test case consists of a line with a word W and an integer N, 0 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing "d-l-p", where d is the document, l the line in that document and p the position of the word in the line.</p>

<h3>Sample input</h3>
<code>
	2<br>
	plasm 2<br>
	chair 12
</code>

<h3>Sample output</h3>

<code>
	2-6905-83<br>
	2-4963-17
</code>

<h2>Submit &amp; test your code</h2>
<p>To test and submit code we provide a set of tools to help you. Download
<a href="https://contest.tuenti.net/Info/tools">contest tools</a> if you haven't already done that. You will then be able to test and submit your solution to this
challenge with the challenge token.</p>
<code>Challenge token: 4mTdIkShEtKhgKGfTLwS</code>
<br>
<h3>To test your program</h3>
<code>./test_challenge 4mTdIkShEtKhgKGfTLwS path/program</code>
<p>A nice output will tell you if your program got the right solution or not. You can try as
many times as you need.</p>
<h3>To submit your program to the challenge</h3>
<code>./submit_challenge 4mTdIkShEtKhgKGfTLwS path/source_pkg.tgz path/program</code>
<p>Note that you first need to solve the test phase before submitting the code. During the submit phase we
might give your program harder questions, so try to make your program failsafe.</p>
<p>Remember <b>you can only submit once!</b> Once your solution is submitted you won't be able to amend it to fix issues or make it faster,
so please be sure your program is finished before submitting it.</p>
<p>If you have any doubts, please check the <a href="https://contest.tuenti.net/Info/help">help section</a>.</p>


<h2>Go ahead</h2>
<h3>I'm done! :)</h3>
<p>Once you have submitted your code, hit refresh and continue to next challenge.</p>
<h3>I'm stuck! :(</h3>
<p>Be sure you follow the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/TuentiEng">Tuenti Engineering</a> twitter for updates and
possible hints during the contest.</p>
<p>If this challenge is too hard and you are blocked, you will be able to skip it after two hours. Note that
<strong>you won't be able to complete it later</strong>, and you have a limited number of challenges to skip.</p>
<p>Finally, if you run out of skips but are still really stuck with one problem, you will be able to skip it after 24 hours.</p>
