Here are my solutions for challenges 1-19.

Every challenge has two .php files: the original that I sent to you
when I submitted the challenge (it has the "_old" suffix), and a
commented version of that code (because I wasn't used to do
that, but some people asked me to comment my solutions).

I run these scripts using 32bit PHP-CLI (of course) 5.3.8 under Windows 7 (battery lasts more here),
and the extension BCMath to calculate big numbers.

Some challenges have aditional files explaining their environment.


I haven't got too much theoric knowledge about programming, but the things I
know were learnt from experience (3 years). So don't expect professional code ;)
